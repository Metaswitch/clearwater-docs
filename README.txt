A	Third Party Software Attributions

The following third party components are included with Project Clearwater, and are made 
available by third parties under separate license terms.  Applicable license terms and 
information regarding the authors and copyright holders are provided along with the 
applicable source files included in this distribution.


A.1	ACE
Copyright and Licensing Information for ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), 
and CoSMIC(TM)
ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE>(TM), and CoSMIC(TM) (henceforth 
referred to as "DOC software") are copyrighted by Douglas C. Schmidt and 
his research group at Washington University, University of California, Irvine, 
and Vanderbilt University, Copyright (c) 1993-2009, all rights reserved. Since DOC 
software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to use, modify, copy, 
and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software source code and object 
code produced from the source, as well as copy and distribute modified versions of this 
software. You must, however, include this copyright statement along with any code built 
using DOC software that you release. No copyright statement needs to be provided if 
you just ship binary executables of your software products.
You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are 
under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using DOC 
software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code, 
such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a 
way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an open-source 
development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in 
your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your 
project in the DOC software success stories.
The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC 
Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for 
Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development 
of open-source software as part of the open-source software community. Submissions 
are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever, including any 
warranty of merchantability, noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or 
fitness for any particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct, 
indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including without 
limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Likewise, 
DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties 
of design, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or 
arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC 
Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with 
respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC 
software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC 
Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students be liable for any lost 
revenue or profits or other special, indirect and consequential damages.
DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of 
Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to 
assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement. A number of 
companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. 
DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-
compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule 
passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005," which established new 
daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand DST as of March 
2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and calendaring information from 
operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they 
upgrade their operating systems accordingly.
The names ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), CoSMIC(TM), Washington 
University, UC Irvine, and Vanderbilt University, may not be used to endorse or 
promote products or services derived from this source without express written 
permission from Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University. This 
license grants no permission to call products or services derived from this source 
ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), or CoSMIC(TM), nor does it grant 
permission for the name Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University to
